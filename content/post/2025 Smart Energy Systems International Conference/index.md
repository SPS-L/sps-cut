Our doctoral researcher, Savvas Panagi, participated in the Smart Energy Systems Conference 2025, held in Copenhagen.

The conference focused on integrated approaches for sustainable energy systems, with a particular emphasis on heating and cooling (H&C) technologies. Key topics included modeling, operational strategies, and model predictive control, offering valuable insights into the evolving role of H&C in sector-coupled energy systems.

Savvasâ€™s research within the DENSE project aims to develop methodologies for the coordinated operation and planning of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs), photovoltaic systems (PVs), and electrical networks. The knowledge and perspectives gained at the conference will contribute to strengthening this work, especially in the context of advancing sector coupling and flexibility in active distribution grids.
