abstract = "The escalating integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into isolated, low-inertia power systems presents considerable challenges to maintaining frequency stability. To preserve operational security, system operators often impose stringent requirements that can necessitate RES curtailment, particularly during periods of low demand. While such measures predominantly affect large-scale distributed energy resources (DERs), prolonged curtailment scenarios may also compel output reductions from numerous small-scale, often uncontrollable, DERs (UDERs). Prevailing control strategies for UDERs typically rely on the deployment of dedicated control and communication hardware at each UDER site, incurring significant capital expenditure and implementation complexity. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the coordinated curtailment of UDERs, which circumvents the need for such supplementary equipment. The proposed approach utilizes the system frequency as an implicit communication conduit, leveraging the inherent active power-frequency (P-f) response capabilities of UDER inverters. A data-driven framework is employed to optimize a global active power-frequency reduction characteristic, tailored from historical operational data. This characteristic is subsequently implemented in a decentralized manner by individual UDERs, thereby effectively mitigating investment costs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with conventional control architectures. The performance and efficacy of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through dynamic simulations on a model of the isolated, low-inertia power system of Cyprus."
