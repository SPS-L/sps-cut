abstract = "The penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in Cyprus's power system has increased significantly in recent years. However, this growth poses substantial challenges, primarily due to limitations in distribution networks arising from network congestion and voltage security issues. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing solutions for enhancing RES hosting capacity, together with a robust methodology for evaluating their effectiveness. To address voltage-related challenges, centralised voltage control strategies at power transformers are combined with adaptive inverter settings to ensure stable operation under increasing RES penetration. Network reinforcements and medium-voltage (MV) upgrades are also considered as complementary measures. At the low-voltage (LV) level, export limitation schemes (ELS) tailored for residential prosumers are proposed, with optimal limits determined for both single- and three-phase installations at targeted RES penetration levels. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is validated using real MV and LV networks from the Cyprus distribution system, ensuring alignment with the strategic planning framework of the distribution system operator of Cyprus. The findings provide a scientific basis for optimising RES integration, addressing both operational and strategic challenges in modern power systems."
