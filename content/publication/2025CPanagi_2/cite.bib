    abstract = {The integration of uncontrolled electric vehicles (EVs) in residential areas introduces new dynamics to the load profile, necessitating a redefinition of the requirements for the distribution network infrastructure. This paper proposes a comprehensive EV modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the impact of uncontrolled EV charging on three-phase low- voltage distribution networks. The distribution system modeling utilizes realistic data, including survey responses, smart meter readings, and statistical datasets collected over several years. This approach is crucial to identifying potential issues in network components and evaluating whether power quality remains within acceptable limits under various EV and photovoltaic (PV) penetration scenarios. The analysis reveals that transformer loading is the most critical parameter affected by EV integration. On the contrary, increasing the PV penetration has a negligible impact on the networkâ€™s minimum voltage and maximum voltage unbalance factor during uncontrolled EV charging.
