abstract = "Modern electric power systems with high levels of penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) often present frequency security problems. The lack of inertia due to the reduced number of synchronous generators in these systems, in combination with the usual inability of RES to provide frequency support, leads to system operators having to curtail RES or rely heavily on Under Frequency Load Shedding schemes to ensure frequency security. Fast Frequency Reserves (FFR) have been proposed as a solution to strengthen the frequency support of the system and alleviate security problems. FFR allows mitigating Rate of Change of Frequency, Nadir, and post-fault frequency steady-state problems after an event. In this paper, we present, analyze, implement and compare five FFR controllers to alleviate frequency security problems in low-inertia grids. The low-inertia, islanded, Cyprus dynamic model is used to quantify the results and exhibit the impact on a real system."
