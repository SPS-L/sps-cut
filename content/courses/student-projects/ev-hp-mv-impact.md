## Background and Objectives

In modern distribution systems, increasing electrification through Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Heat Pumps (HPs) is expected to significantly change load patterns, especially at the Medium Voltage (MV) level. These technologies introduce high and temporally correlated demand, which can affect voltage profiles, thermal limits, losses, and power quality of MV feeders. Despite increasing penetration forecasts for EVs and HPs, the impact on MV system performance under realistic scenarios has not been comprehensively assessed.

This project aims to fill this gap by constructing MV network load models incorporating projected EV and HP demand profiles and performing sensitivity and scenario analysis to evaluate their effect on network performance metrics[^R1][^R2].

The student will:

- Review EV and HP load modelling methodologies and their distribution network impact.
- Construct MV network models in pandapower[^pandapower] incorporating projected EV and HP demand profiles.
- Develop scenario-based simulations covering different penetration levels and temporal patterns.
- Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect on voltage profiles, thermal loading, losses, and power quality.
- Provide recommendations for network planning under increasing EV and HP adoption.

This project requires excellent *programming* skills. It is in collaboration with [EAC](http:/www.eac.com.cy).

## Deliverables

- A literature review report summarizing EV & HP load modelling and distribution impact studies.
- A technical report with methodology, simulation setup, and assumptions.
- Simulation models and code (pandapower / Python).
- Results and analysis of MV performance under scenarios.
- Presentation slides summarizing key findings.

## Student profile

- Very good programming skills in Python.
- Background in electric power systems (minimum [Power Systems I]({{< ref "/courses/een320/_index.md">}})).
