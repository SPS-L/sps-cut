The STEPSS software is made up of three modules:

- PFC (for Power Flow Computation) performs a power flow computation in order to determine the initial operating point of a dynamic simulation
- RAMSES (for RApid Multiprocessor Simulation of Electric power Systems) simulates the dynamic evolution of the power system in response to disturbances/actions specified by the user
- CODEGEN (for CODE GENerator) translates a model described by the user in a text file into its equivalent in FORTRAN 2003 language. The latter has to be compiled and linked to a user-defined executable version RAMSES.
