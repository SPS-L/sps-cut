## Extended Description  

The Data-Driven Power System Methods research theme explores how modern machine-learning and statistical-learning techniques can be harnessed to operate, control, and plan increasingly complex electrical grids. Our work spans the entire data pipeline—from measurement acquisition to real-time decision making—with a particular emphasis on distribution networks where high penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaics, wind turbines, battery storage, and electric vehicles are rapidly changing power‐flow patterns.  

### Focus Areas

- State awareness: We develop physics-informed neural networks and probabilistic estimators that infer voltages, currents, and power flows from sparse or low-quality sensor data, enabling system operators to maintain visibility without costly metering roll-outs.  

- Forecasting and scenario generation: Using deep learning, ensemble learning, and generative models, the group produces high-resolution forecasts of load, renewable production, and market prices to support short-term operations and long-term planning.  

- Data-driven control design: We design local and distributed controllers for inverter-based DERs that emulate optimal power-flow policies, provide synthetic inertia, or mitigate voltage and congestion issues—all learned directly from historical or simulated grid behaviour.  

- Grid-edge optimisation: Reinforcement-learning agents and convex surrogate models are used to co-optimise flexible demand, storage, and network assets, delivering services such as peak-shaving, frequency regulation, and congestion relief.  

- Anomaly detection and resilience: By combining graph-signal processing with unsupervised learning, we detect cyber-physical disturbances, equipment malfunctions, and extreme-weather impacts in real time, improving grid reliability.  

### Methodology and Collaboration  

Our approach is highly interdisciplinary:  

- Physics-guided ML integrates first-principles power-flow equations with data-driven models, ensuring physical plausibility and strong generalisation.  
- Open data and code: The lab curates benchmark feeders, measurement datasets, and open-source toolchains to accelerate reproducibility and community adoption.  
- Stakeholder engagement: Projects are conducted in partnership with DSOs, TSOs, technology vendors, and academic collaborators worldwide, translating research prototypes into field-demonstrated solutions.  

### Impact  

The outcomes of this research theme include:  

- Algorithms that allow operators to safely run feeders at higher DER penetrations without expensive network reinforcements.  
- Toolkits that help planners quantify hosting capacity, evaluate climate-driven risk, and prioritise grid-modernisation investments.  
- Control strategies that unlock new revenue streams for prosumers while supporting system-wide decarbonisation targets.  

Ultimately, our data-driven methods pave the way toward a resilient, low-carbon electricity system that is intelligent, adaptive, and equitable.
